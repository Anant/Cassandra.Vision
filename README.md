# cassandra.vision
Tools for Offline Cassandra log and nodetool output analysis via ELK/FEK (Elastic, Logstash, Filebeat &amp; Kibana) and Visual analysis of TableStats/CFStats using Excel. 

These tools are for offline cluster monitoring. If you are looking *online* cluster monitoring, [check out Cassandra.toolkit instead](https://github.com/Anant/cassandra.toolkit/blob/master/docs/setup/setup.recommendations.md#our-recommendation-monitoring).

# Overview

### What is Offline Log Analysis?

Sometimes it is preferable to do "online log analysis", which is where you collect logs and metrics on a live cluster and monitor using Kibana, Grafana or some other dashboard. However, there are situations where this is not possible or preferable and you want to grab some logs, put them in a tarball, and ingest into your dashboard, often running in a separate host. We call this "offline log analysis". 

# Getting Started
Cassandra.vision provides three different tools for offline analysis. Combined, these tools can collect and visualize log files and nodetool command output, so that you can easily see what's going on with your cluster without having to install anything on your Cassandra nodes.

The main tool is "Cassandra Analyzer", which also runs commands from the other two tools, "TableAnalyzer" and "NodeAnalyzer". However, "TableAnalyzer" and "NodeAnalyzer" can also be ran on their own as standalone tools.

| Tool | Description | 
| -----| ----------- | 
| [Cassandra Analyzer](./cassandra-analyzer/README.md) | A tool to collect log files and nodetool output from your Cassandra cluster into a tarball and ingest the logs so they can be visualized using our prebuilt Kibana dashboard. These python scripts also run commands from TableAnalyzer and NodeAnalyzer (see below) and includes results in the tarball. After running this, you will be able to either view your logs in the Kibana dashboard, perform data model review using the formatted spreadsheet generated by TableAnalyzer, or take the tarball that was collected and run other types of analytics. | 
| [TableAnalyzer](./cassandra-analyzer/offline-log-collector/TableAnalyzer/README.md) | A tool for analyzing Cassandra (CFStats/TableStats) output that visualizes variance in metrics between nodes. We use TableAnalyzer to generate a conditionally-formatted spreadsheet that can be used to perform data model review. Although TableAnalyzer can be ran as part of Cassandra Analyzer it can also be ran on its own. | 
| [NodeAnalyzer](./cassandra-analyzer/offline-log-collector/NodeAnalyzer/README.md) | A quick and dirty tool to grab all the information for a specific node using nodetool and tarzip it into a tarball. Although NodeAnalyzer can be ran as part of Cassandra Analyzer it can also be ran on its own. |
